      <h2>4 Beds & 3 Baths ($339,900)<br />
        Location: 714 N Walnut Ln, Schaumburg IL </h2>
      Schaumburg just got rated as the Best Place to Live in Illinois by Money Magazine. I probably don't need to
      continue but I will anyway.
      This is a well-maintained and updated home in a premium part of Schaumburg. The home sits on a quiet street, in a
      a low-traffic cul-de-sac, and there are seemingly endless parks, recreation, entertain, shopping, and dining
      nearby. The home itself features: NEW windows (2015) ; NEW carpet and laminate flooring (2018) ; NEW HVAC (2012)
      w/a high efficiency furnace ; UPDATED kitchen w/granite counters & SS appliances ; HARDWOOD floors ; Fenced yard ;
      NEW paint ; Outdoor living w/a deck and brick paver patio ; so much more. The list just goes on...I could mention
      the large wood-sash windows that flood
      the main floor with light, or the 4 seasons room in the back, or all the new ceiling fans that were
      installed...but I won't. Come see this gem before it's gone!</p>
