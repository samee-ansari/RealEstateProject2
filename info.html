      <h2>Josh Altman</h2>
      <img src="images/altman.png">
      <p>Josh’s clientele consists primarily of A-list celebrities, professional athletes, business leaders and high net
        worth individuals from around the globe. Josh has sold over $1.5 Billion in real estate including the most
        expensive one bedroom house in history, which sold for over $20,000,000. At any time he has over $350,000,000 in
        listings.

        Along with his older brother Matt, Josh created the Altman Brothers, a one-stop real estate firm that provides
        both buyers and sellers with their exclusive white-glove, VIP treatment.

        Josh is known for his ability to listen and understand his clients’ needs, allowing him to continuously deliver
        above and beyond their goals and expectations. His personable and professional character allow Josh to build and
        maintain solid relationships, which explains why his business has grown mostly from referrals and repeat
        clients.

      <h2> Josh Flagg</h2>
      <img src="images/flagg.png">
      <p>Josh Flagg is one of America's most successful and sought after luxury real estate agents, having completed
        more
        than two billion dollars in residential real estate sales in the past decade. As of 2015, Flagg has become the
        number one volume agent in Los Angeles and the number two agent in sales in California. In the first half of
        2015,
        he sold $147,000,000, which included 20 homes over $5,000,000. By the end of the year he completed $226,000,000.
        In 2016 he sold $303,000,000.

        Josh has been setting sales and price per square foot records in and around Beverly Hills since he began his
        career at the age of 18, while still in high school! Josh has sold the most expensive home ever in the flats of
        Beverly Hills and held the listing for two of the most expensive homes in the United States, one offered at
        $100,000,000 and the other offered at $150,000,000.

        His record-selling achievements include the highest-priced home sale in Brentwood Park which he sold twice
        within
        30 days as well as the third most expensive home sold in Trousdale Estates, which was one of four sales Josh
        completed in Trousdale in that particular year. Flagg's keen eye for real estate allowed him to sell four houses
        in 2016, and resell each single one of them for his clients within a three month span for a million dollars
        profit
        on each. Each one of these homes was priced between five and ten million dollars. In 2017, Josh sold one of the
        great estates of Los Angeles, the home of style icon Betsy Bloomingdale for just under $40,000,000 in an off
        market transaction. He also sold six homes north of $15,000,000.
